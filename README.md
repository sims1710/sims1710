  Hi! I am Simriti ‚ò∫Ô∏èüåº‚ú® 
</p>

<p align="center">
  I always had an interest in computing. I started using computers when I was 2 years old to play the Magic School Bus Game. Now, I am learning Software Engineering at SUTD to build software. You can follow my adventure here on GitHub! So far, I have been learning a lot about computers and coding and have been having a lot of fun along the way! I hope I can keep expanding my repertoire forever!
