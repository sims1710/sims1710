  Hi! I am Simriti ☺️🌼✨ 
</p>

<p align="center">
  I always had an interest in computing. I started using computers when I was 2 years old to play the Magic School Bus Game. Now, I am learning Cybersecurity at SUTD to protect the world of computers against cyberattacks. To me, it sounds like a fantasy game where I am the heroine defeating the villains to protect the kingdom 😊😂 You can follow my adventure here on GitHub! So far, I have been learning a lot about computers and coding and have been having a lot of fun along the way! I hope I can keep expanding my repertoire forever!
